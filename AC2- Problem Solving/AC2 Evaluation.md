- Initial Reactions- will it be hard, easy, etc
	Why?
- What am I going to do?

# Idea Generation
- Idea Generation - at least 5
- Multiple game ideas
- Evaluate them and pick one
To begin I generated some ideas that take inspiration from the games I researched in the  [[AC1 Evaluation]].
I wanted to take the parts of each game that I enjoyed, while trying to fix the issues I had with them. 
## Game 1: PULYA
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Mouse-based crosshair (no Aim-Assist)
- The "Draw" of the game is that you can shoot enemies' bullets out of the air, and deflect them back.
- It will have an ability system including passive upgrades and abilities (like a hero shooter, I.E. shields, AOE damage/crowd control, new movement tech such as dashing, charged shot for more damage, etc)
- Dark Souls style level design with lots of secret passages and shortcuts, with semi-random generation of prefab rooms (similar to [[Enter the Gungeon]]). This can teach younger audiences about spatial awareness and mapping areas in their head.
## Game 2: WORKINGTITLE
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Auto-aiming. Option to turn off auto-aim and use Mouse-based crosshair instead
- Similar to [[Risk of Rain 2]], Every 1 minute, the difficulty ticks up a level. Each time this happens, you can select from 3 difficulty-increasing "upgrades."
- Weapons and abilities randomly spawn around the level. They can be unlocked by trading in a certain number of kills (one kill is one "coin").
## Game 3: WORKINGTITLE2
- Action Platformer, side-on 2D shooter. This is more familiar to a younger audience as they may be more acquainted with games like Mario or Rayman. 
- Similar to [[Noita]] in shooting gameplay (aiming style, weapon cooldown/projectile speed)
- Shop area at the end of each level where you can buy abilities and passive upgrades
