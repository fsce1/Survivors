	Why?
- What am I going to do?

# Idea Generation
- Idea Generation - at least 3, more wanted
- Multiple game ideas
- Evaluate them and pick one
- 
To begin I generated some ideas that take inspiration from the games I researched in the  [[AC1 Evaluation]].
I wanted to take the parts of each game that i enjoyed, while trying to fix the issues I had with them. 
## Game 1: PULYA
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Mouse-based crosshair (no Aim-Assist)
- The "Draw" of the game is that you can shoot enemies' bullets out of the air, and deflect them back.
- It will have an upgrade system including passive stat increases and abilities (like a hero shooter, I.E. shields, AOE damage/crowd control, new movement tech such as dashing)
## Game 2: WORKINGTITLE
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Auto-aiming. Option to turn off auto-aim and use Mouse-based crosshair instead
- Similar to [[Risk of Rain 2]], Every 2 minutes, the difficulty ticks up a level. Each time this happens, you can select from 3 difficulty-increasing "upgrades."
- Weapons and abilities randomly spawn around the level.They can be unlocked by trading in a certain number of kills (one kill is one "coin").
