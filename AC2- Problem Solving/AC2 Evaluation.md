# Response to Brief
- Summary of what I need to actually do to finish this assignment
- Initial Reactions- will it be hard, easy, etc
	Why?
- What am I going to do?

# Idea Generation
- Idea Generation - at least 5
- Multiple game ideas
- Evaluate them and pick one
To begin I generated some ideas that take inspiration from the games I researched in the  [[AC1 Evaluation]].
I wanted to take the parts of each game that I enjoyed, while trying to fix the issues I had with them. 
## Game 1: PULYA
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Mouse-based crosshair (no Aim-Assist)
- The "Draw" of the game is that you can shoot enemies' bullets out of the air, and deflect them back.
- It will have an ability system including passive upgrades and abilities (like a hero shooter, I.E. shields, AOE damage/crowd control, new movement tech such as dashing, charged shot for more damage, etc)
- Dark Souls style level design with lots of secret passages and shortcuts, with semi-random generation of prefab rooms (similar to [[Enter the Gungeon]]). This can teach younger audiences about spatial awareness and mapping areas in their head.
## Game 2: SURVIVORS
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Auto-aiming. Option to turn off auto-aim and use Mouse-based crosshair instead
- Similar to [[Risk of Rain 2]], Every 1 minute, the difficulty ticks up a level. Each time this happens, you can select from 3 difficulty-increasing "upgrades."
- Weapons and abilities randomly spawn around the level. They can be unlocked by trading in a certain number of kills (one kill is one "coin").
## Game 3: SURVIVORS2
- Action Platformer, side-on 2D shooter. This is more familiar to a younger audience as they may be more acquainted with games like Mario or Rayman. 
- Similar to [[Noita]] in shooting gameplay (aiming style, weapon cooldown/projectile speed)
- Shop area at the end of each level where you can buy abilities and passive upgrades 
- Tile-based generation of level sections (similar to [[Enter the Gungeon]], but side-on). This makes the game more replayable without getting into the complication of real procedural generation.
## Game 4: AUTOMATON
- Top-Down 2D Shooter, Auto-aiming.
- Automation controls such as auto-shooting, inventory management and combining upgrades.
- This would be very hard to create in one month, as it requires a lot of systems and different layers of controls.
- However it would be very interesting to create as this genre of game hasn't really been done with such a level of automation.

## Evaluation

Game 1, PULYA, was a good idea, however it would take too long to finish, as the level design is a large part of the gameplay. This would mean spending extra time on tilesets for art, drawing up plans for the level, and code for procedural generation of rooms that do not intersect and can be easily traversed. This means that i would have to spend less time on other parts of the game, and it would be a lot of work.

Game 3, SURVIVORS2, would be my second choice as it is almost as simple as SURVIVORS. However I think the bullet-hell aspects of the game would not work as well, since there would be lots of cover and blocks for the bullets to collide with. I would also need to figure out how AI would work, as it would need to pathfind around complex geometry.

Game 4, AUTOMATON, is another interesting idea, however it would likely be way too complex for this size of assignment. It would also not fit the brief as well as others, as it would require a lot of logic and micro-management. This means it may be too complex or difficult for a 10-15y/o to understand. 

Game 2, SURVIVORS, was my final choice. This was because it was unique enough that it provided a fresh take on the roguelike genre, without getting too complicated with systems (such as AUTOMATON).
