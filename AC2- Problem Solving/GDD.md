## Power-ups
- Auto-aim "Target Acquisition" speed up, stack-able until it snaps onto enemies instantly

enemy kill count is the same as currency, trading souls like DS
buy upgrades with souls

meta progression is reaching milestones of number of kills

keep on shooting by holding space, e and q cycle through weapons

every 1 minute you get to decide (like a vampire survivor level-up) what part of the game you want to be harder (more health, more damage, faster movement, etc)
- enemies move faster 
- more enemy health
- more damage
- enemy bullets move faster/area up
- etc.

# Interactive Objects
Scattered throughout the level, there are player upgrades. These cost kills to pick up (starting at 10 and increasing by 5 each time), and make your character more powerful. 
Different weapons are also pickups in the map, though they don't cost any money to acquire. they will be placed further out from the spawn point depending on the quality of the weapon (you start with a pistol, then shotgun, then machine gun, etc.)
# Level Design 
The level design should be kept simple, as complications could occur with enemy pathfinding it could get frustrating for players to be trapped in an area, unable to dodge bullets or enemies. The bullets/enemies "become" the environment that the player has to traverse through
# Art Style 
I think a simple art-style would work for this game, so I chose an ASCII-based text style. This could be mixed with some post-processing effects such as Chromatic Aberration and Lens Distortion to give the game a "CRT Monitor" effect, like you are playing on an old computer/arcade game.
