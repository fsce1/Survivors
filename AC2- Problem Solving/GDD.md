## Powerups
- Auto-aim "Target Acquisition" speed up, stackable until it snaps onto enemies instantly

enemy kill count is the same as currency, trading souls like DS
buy upgrades with souls
meta preogression is reaching milestones of number of kills


keep on shooting by holding space, e and q cycle through weapons


every 5 minutes you get to decide (like a vampire survivor level) what part of the game you want to be harder (more health, more damage, faster movement, etc)
