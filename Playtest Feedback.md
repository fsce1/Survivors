This game is really good. I have a bit of feedback: 
-   The overall movement of both the enemies, the player and the Bullets are a bit slow. They could be sped up a bit more. 
-   After a while the enemies stopped spawning, but I think there were a few still alive off the screen because bullets were coming from the top left corner. 
-   It would be good to see more a variety of types of enemies
