ROR2 is a 3D Third Person Shooter, in which you fight through a level to get to a teleporter to the next one.
There are swarms of enemies, especially as the level progresses, and you are usually fighting 6+ enemies at one time.
Enemies drop money, which is reset every time you enter a teleporter. You can use this money to unlock Chests that you find strewn around the level.
These Chests give you upgrades, such as higher critical hit chance, and unique passive abilities such as Igniting enemies in a radius around every kill you achieve, etc.
You can also unlock Equipment, which works like an Ultimate in most team-based shooters and MOBAs. Its a powerful ability that takes a long amount of time, usually over a minute, to recharge.
There are a number of other things alongside Chests that you can find, including a 3D printer, which removes a random upgrade and gives you the item displayed on its screen; A Scrapper where you can choose to recycle an upgrade for a free 3D Printer token; etc.

It prioritises building synergies between different upgrades, as stacking abilities is very powerful.
Once you complete each level, you lose all of your money. this encourages you to get all of the upgrades you possibly can, so you don't waste money
