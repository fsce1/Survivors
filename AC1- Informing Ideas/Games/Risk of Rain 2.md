ROR2 is a 3D Third Person Shooter, in which you fight through a level to get to a teleporter to the next one.
There are swarms of enemies, especially as the level progresses, and you are usually fighting 6+ enemies at one time.
Enemies drop money, which is reset every time you enter a teleporter. You can use this money to unlock Chests that you find strewn around the level.
These Chests give you upgrades, such as higher critical hit chance, and unique passive abilities such as Igniting enemies in a radius around every kill you achieve, etc.
You can also unlock Equipment, which works like an Ultimate in most team-based shooters and MOBAs. Its a powerful ability that takes a long amount of time, usually over a minute, to recharge.
There are a number of other things alongside Chests that you can find, including a 3D printer, which removes a random upgrade and gives you the item displayed on its screen; A Scrapper where you can choose to recycle an upgrade for a free 3D Printer token; etc.

ROR2 priorities building synergies between different upgrades, as stacking abilities is very powerful.

Once you complete each level, you lose all of your money. this encourages you to get all of the upgrades you possibly can before moving to the next level, so you don't waste money. 

## Evaluation
One thing that i like about this game is that there are different characters who have very different abilities and movement options. This allows you to play the game and create your builds in an extremely personalized way and create your preferred character. For Example, you can play as a highly-mobile character with a lot of precision attacks for high damage, or a slow-moving, AOE and crowd-control "tank" character.
I also like how positioning comes into play with a lot of the characters. [[Vampire Survivors]] moves very slow, and progression happens over a long period of time, however ROR2 allows you to move very quickly and accelerate the starting difficulty if you need to. This means the player has more options and is able to play how they want

However, I think the game can be quite daunting for new players. This is because you are able to roll any item in the game from the very start. This makes it hard to learn the game, as you are overloaded with many items to learn at the start.
I may lock some items behind kill milestones/achievements (such as "kill 50,000 enemies in a single run"), to drip-feed the items and lessen the learning curve for new players.
