ETG is a top-down 2D roguelike that takes inspiration from bullet-hell games.
You start each level with a starter pistol and your main method of upgrade is picking up new guns from chests you find.
The level generation consists of multiple rooms that fit together (like puzzle pieces) and are randomly placed each level. You aren't allowed into a different room unless you have cleared the current one of all enemies.
There are many enemy types, such as enemies that throw bombs at you, some that use shotguns, some that are melee only, etc.
