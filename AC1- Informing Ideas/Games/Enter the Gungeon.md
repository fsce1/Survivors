ETG is a top-down 2D roguelike that takes inspiration from bullet-hell games.
You start each level with a starter pistol and your main method of upgrade is picking up new guns from chests you find. There are nearly 200 different weapons, all with unique mechanics and play styles.
The level generation consists of multiple rooms that fit together (like puzzle pieces) and are randomly placed each level. You aren't allowed into a different room unless you have cleared the current one of all enemies.
There are many enemy types, such as enemies that throw bombs at you, some that use shotguns, some that are melee only, etc.
At the end of each level, there is a boss. The boss is chosen randomly based on the stage.
There is also a secondary mechanic called Blanks, which can clear the entire play area of all bullets and enemies. They are fairly limited so they don't get abused.
## Evaluation
Overall I enjoyed this game. It had a very simple but appealing art style, something that i may like to replicate. This game is good for children as it is very readable and easy to understand visually. this helps newer players understand what is happening much easier.
However this game is not very suitable for children as a large part of the teleplay is based on guns. This may be too adult for small children, and the age rating might be too high for the target audience if i add realistic weapons to my game. Therefore, I have decided on an art style that deliberately avoids realistic guns, so it is more suitable for the target audience (10-15y/o).
