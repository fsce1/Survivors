Noita is a 2D side-on platformer rogue-like in which you play as a wizard that can build wands with custom combinations of spells. Spells are items that you can buy after each level, and you can shift around the specific builds at the end of each level.
This allows you to create your own extremely specialized wands and play the game exactly how you want.
As well as this, the game takes inspiration from pixel simulation and sand-box
