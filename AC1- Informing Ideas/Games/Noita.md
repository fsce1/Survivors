Noita is a 2D side-on platformer rogue-like in which you play as a wizard that can build wands with custom combinations of spells. Spells are items that you can buy after each level, and you can shift around the specific builds at the end of each level.
This allows you to create your own extremely specialized wands and play the game exactly how you want.
As well as this, the game takes inspiration from pixel simulation and sand-box games. Every pixel of the environment can be destroyed and has gravity acting on it at all times. This means that you can carve through walls with bombs, or pour oil on your enemies and set them on fire. This allows for extremely creative use of the environment in order to kill enemies and access new areas of the map.
## Evaluation
I enjoy the level of player expression that Noita gives you, as in the late-game you can personalise your loadout and traverse the entire map in a very short amount of time. This game has a very good late-game and many secrets to find.
However, i think it can be way too complex for a 10-15y/o to understand, so if i were to take inspiration from this game, it would have to be simplified a lot.
