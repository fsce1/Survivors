In Vampire Survivors, you play as a selection of characters (that differ slightly) and you fight off hordes of enemies in constantly-increasing numbers.
In order to level up, you pick up small gems (larger enemies drop better gems) which drops on about 50% of the enemies. You need to re-tread your steps to get gems. Once you level up, you can choose 1 of  3 items to take into your inventory (these items can be re-rolled and stack effects)
## Example Items:
- Axe I : Periodically fire an axe that pierces one enemy
- Axe II : Fire one more projectile and Base Damage up by 20
- Garlic : All Base Area up by 10% per stack

## Evaluation
One thing that I like about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty by increasing the number of enemies on screen. This makes it extremely satisfying to wipe an entire screen that was previously full of enemies. It also makes damage scaling much simpler, as the difficulty is not based on damage numbers.
I will expand on this idea by 

One thing that I dislike about this game is that it doesn't allow the player to move through the level at their own pace. I often found I was waiting a long time before the game started to get interesting. It has a very slow start to each round.
In my game, I will ramp up the difficulty more frequently and clearly (with a choice on what specific part of the game should be harder). This means you can tailor the difficulty of the game to yourself and build specific item load-outs to perfectly counter the enemies' weaknesses (chosen by you)
