- How do these Intentions meet the brief?
To begin, I started researching games that I think would fit the brief well and inform me of common practices in the genre. The Brief has asked for a game that teaches practical skills to children from ages 10-15. I believe that looking into the rogue-like genre would be a good fit, as it has a very simple and easily repeatable closed game loop. This means young children would understand the formal aspects of the game in much less time.
The games I looked at were Enter the Gungeon, Risk of Rain 2 and Vampire Survivors. I chose these 3 games because they provided examples of the game loop I want to mimic, where the character builds up their gear over a single run and game fail-states are very easy to understand.
My hope with the game that I will create is that I can teach the basics of gaming to a new audience, with a simple 2D take on rogue-likes and bullet-hells.
Therefore, I've decided to automate a lot of the processes- such as aiming, firing and reloading- that more seasoned gamers are used to dealing with. Aiming and reloading will be automatic, and firing will be full-auto on every gun. My hope is that this lessens the learning curve for new/young players- this fits the brief because it is friendly towards 10-15 year-olds.
When weighing up game engines, I mainly considered Unreal and Unity. That is because both of them are very well supported and have a lot of QOL features. However I chose Unity, as it has better support for 2D environments and I know C# better than C++. It also has many built-in features such as Tilesets and Post-Processing Stacks that can increase the production quality of my game.
