To Plan my project, i used a Trello board, as well as mapping out everything I needed to achieve in a moodboard.
The Trello board was very useful as i could see visually how far everything was completion and i could add/move things as i needed them.
The moodboard was a good initial plan to understand everything i needed to achieve, and i started writing everything from that moodboard into the Trello boards just after.
I also blocked out the individual weeks and made sure I was doing a relevant thing each week, and spreading out the workload across the entire time. This meant I was not forced to crunch at the end, to fix things and finish writing, and my work was well paced out throughout the month.
